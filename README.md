# Introduction

In this project I have created a web component (widget), which displays the current time along with the Humber College logo. The module functionality is in a dedicated module file, and the main application (web page) logic will be in a separate file.

The component appear at the top right, 20px in from the right and 20px down from the top; and is always there, even if the user scrolls. <template> is attached to the Shadow DOM.
